                <h1>Velvet flower</h1>
                <p>
                    Velvet flowers are distinguished by their soft, plush, velvety-textured petals, giving them a rich
                    and luxurious appearance. They symbolize elegance, warmth, and refined beauty. Velvet flowers are
                    often used for decorative arrangements and special displays because they stand out visually and feel
                    unique. Their texture and deep appearance create a sense of sophistication and charm in any setting.

                <h1>Indoor flower</h1>
                <p>
                    Indoor flowers are grown inside homes, offices, and enclosed spaces. They are valued for their
                    ability to beautify interiors and create a calm, comfortable atmosphere. Indoor flowers often
                    require indirect sunlight and gentle care. They symbolize peace, freshness, and emotional comfort,
                    bringing natural beauty and positive energy into daily living spaces.

                    sunlight, fresh air, and natural conditions. These flowers represent life, growth, and vitality,
                    adding color and character to landscapes. Outdoor flowers create a strong connection with nature and
                    are admired for their resilience and vibrant presence.

                <h1>Plant</h1>
                <p>
                    A plant is a living organism that grows in the soil and needs
                     sunlight, water, air, and nutrients to
                    survive.
                    It makes its own food through a process called photosynthesis.
                    Plants have roots, stems, leaves, flowers, and fruits.
                    The roots hold the plant in the ground and absorb water.
                    The stem supports the plant and carries water and food.
                    The leaves make food using sunlight.
                    Flowers help the plant reproduce, and fruits protect the seeds.
